Figures:

   Going through this list looking at the Mathematia based figures to see which should be updated
   (PlotStyle -> Thick and so forth)

      phy485-optics
         -- repost those when that's done.

   -- dashes in version_bash.tex aren't showing up properly.  Figure out (probably applies to all.)

Rework as 6x9 and post to kdp (for draft copies)
#  450  -- e&m
#  485  -- optics
#  452  -- stat mech
#  487  -- condensed matter
   2403 -- fields i/p.
   454  -- fluid mechanics

   356 -- qm I
   456 -- qm II
   1229 -- antenna

   1254 -- multiphysics << unredacted for myself.
   1520 -- grad qm      << unredacted for myself.

phy450:
   refresh on kdp and on wordpress http server -- contents was the page heading for everything!
   -- update the changelog on the blog.

6x9 instructions:

- specialize: 
   backmatter.tex
   GNUmakefile # new path for $(THISBOOK).tex, ...
   thisbook.sty
   classicthesis-config.tex
   hack preface.tex for the page numbering position bug (add: \thispagestyle{empty})
   customize the dedication and change the rules to avoid the generic one being used (do this for phy485)

   git commit -a
   make clean;make
