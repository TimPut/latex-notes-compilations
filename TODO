   Go through all the pdf links, and if any are to non-versioned versions, update those, and
   add separate landing pages for each of these:

   phy1520
      - use thick for the mathematica figures.

Figures:

   Going through this list looking at the Mathematia based figures to see which should be updated
   (PlotStyle -> Thick and so forth)

      phy487-qmsolids
      ece1254-multiphysics

GAelectrodynamics
   -- apply phy450/backmatter.tex index markup to get index to show up properly in the contents like the bib.
   -- use the emptypage logic from phy450 -- note that this requires \endgroup's and not using those 
      in 452 resulted in NO-PAGE-NUMBERS!

450, 452, GAelectrodynamics
   -- dashes in version_bash.tex aren't showing up properly.  Figure out (probably applies to all.)

Rework as 6x9 and post to kdp (for draft copies)
#   452  -- stat mech
      -- update landing page when kdp link is available.  
#   450  -- e&m
   485  -- optics
   487  -- condensed matter

maybe (redacted):
   1254 -- multiphysics
   1520 -- quantum
   2403 -- fields
