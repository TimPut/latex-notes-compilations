   add separate landing pages for each of these:

      - use thick for the mathematica figures.

Figures:

   Going through this list looking at the Mathematia based figures to see which should be updated
   (PlotStyle -> Thick and so forth)

   -- dashes in version_bash.tex aren't showing up properly.  Figure out (probably applies to all.)

Rework as 6x9 and post to kdp (for draft copies)
   356 -- qm I
#   450  -- e&m
   456 -- qm II
   454  -- fluid mechanics
   485  -- optics <<< AFTER 487.
#   452  -- stat mech
*  487  -- condensed matter <<< NEXT.
   1254 -- multiphysics
   1229 -- antenna
   1520 -- grad qm
   1520 -- quantum
   2403 -- fields

6x9 instructions:

- specialize: 
   backmatter.tex
   GNUmakefile
   thisbook.sty
   classicthesis-config.tex
   $(THISBOOK).tex -- patch and git add it.

   make clean;make

these are all basically identical I think (452, 450, GAe, 487) ... use common version from alterate path.

   $(THISBOOK).tex
